## ICU for iOS, visionOS, macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon M1) & Catalyst - arm64 / x86_64

Supported versions: 76.1, 75.1, 74.2, 74.1, 73.2, 73.1, 72.1, 71.1, 70.1, 69.1, 68.2, 62.2

This repo provides a universal script for building static ICU libraries for use in iOS, visionOS, and macOS applications. The actual ICU library version is taken from https://github.com/unicode-org/icu . The repo branches correspond to the suitable branches of ICU repo. E.g. "76" branch corresponds to "maint/maint-76" branch.

## Prerequisites
  1) Xcode must be installed because xcodebuild is used to create xcframeworks
  2) ```xcode-select -p``` must point to Xcode app developer directory (by default e.g. /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer). If it points to CommandLineTools directory you should execute:
  ```sudo xcode-select --reset``` or ```sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer```
  
## How to build?
 - Manually
```
    # clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/apotocki/icu4c-iosx
    
    # build libraries
    cd icu4c-iosx
    scripts/build.sh

    # have fun, the result artifacts  will be located in 'product' folder.
```    
 - Use cocoapods. Add the following lines into your project's Podfile:
```
    use_frameworks!

    pod 'icu4c-iosx'
    # or optionally more precisely
    # pod 'icu4c-iosx', :git => 'https://github.com/apotocki/icu4c-iosx'
```    
install new dependency:
```
   pod install --verbose
```

## As advertising...
The ICU libraries that have been built by this project are being used in my iOS application on the App Store:

This application is designed to view and edit files at the byte or character level; calculate different hashes, encode/decode, and compress/decompress desired byte regions.
  
You can support my open-source development by trying the [App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/potohex/id1620963302).
